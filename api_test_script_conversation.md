# API Test Script Development Conversation Transcript

## Initial Request

**User:** can you create a quick script to hit all api end points with curl

## Analysis and Planning Phase

I analyzed the TaskHub codebase to understand the available API endpoints by examining:

- `src/controllers/taskController.ts` - Task CRUD operations, tag attachments
- `src/controllers/workspaceController.ts` - Workspace creation, API key generation, stats
- `src/controllers/tagController.ts` - Tag upsert operations
- `src/index.ts` - Route structure and server configuration
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts

**Identified Endpoints:**
- Workspaces: POST /workspaces, POST /workspaces/:wsId/apikeys, GET /workspaces/:wsId/stats
- Tasks: POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE /workspaces/:wsId/tasks, POST /workspaces/:wsId/tasks/:taskId/tags/:name
- Tags: PUT /workspaces/:wsId/tags/:name
- Test: GET /test

## Initial Implementation

Created `test_api.sh` with:
- Color-coded output functions
- Separate functions for authenticated and non-authenticated requests
- All endpoints with sample data
- Proper error handling and response display
- Made executable with `chmod +x`

## User Feedback and Iterations

### Request 1: API Key Integration
**User:** all tests after #3 should use the api key returned from #3 Generate API key. this is set via the header "x-api-key: API_KEY"

**Changes Made:**
- Modified script to extract API key from response using `jq`
- Updated header format from "X-API-Key" to "x-api-key" (lowercase)
- Added dynamic workspace ID extraction
- Added dynamic task ID extraction
- Improved error handling for ID extraction failures

### Request 2: Enhanced Test Coverage
**User:** can you create 6 tasks instead of two and create 4 tags for the tests, can you run get stats at the end, and test 16 delete task fails with error code 404 but it is actually passing considering the 17th test verify task deletion

**Changes Made:**
- Created 6 diverse tasks with different statuses and due dates
- Created 4 tags (urgent, bug, feature, documentation) using loops
- Added arrays to store multiple task IDs and tag names
- Enhanced tag attachment to multiple tasks
- Added final workspace stats call
- Fixed delete test logic (initially implemented double delete for 404 test)

### Request 3: Revert Delete Test
**User:** can you undo the delete change

**Changes Made:**
- Reverted delete test back to single delete operation
- Kept the final stats call and other enhancements

## Bug Discovery and Fix

During testing, the delete operation returned 404. Analysis revealed:

**Bug Location:** `src/controllers/taskController.ts:140`
**Issue:** SQL query parameters were swapped
```typescript
// Before (buggy):
[wsId, taskId] // WHERE id = $1 AND workspace_id = $2

// After (fixed):
[taskId, wsId] // WHERE id = $1 AND workspace_id = $2
```

**Root Cause:** The query was checking `WHERE id = workspace_id AND workspace_id = task_id` instead of the correct parameter mapping.

## Documentation Request

**User:** awesome, this was worked, can you add the instructions for this temporary test file to the readME of the project

**Changes Made:**
- Added comprehensive "API Testing Script" section to README.md
- Included usage instructions, feature list, and capabilities
- Documented the script's dual purpose as testing tool and API documentation

## Final Script Capabilities

The final `test_api.sh` script includes:

1. **Workspace Management:**
   - Create workspace
   - Generate API key
   - Get workspace stats (initial and final)

2. **Task Management:**
   - Create 6 diverse tasks with different statuses and due dates
   - List all tasks
   - Filter by status, due date, search terms
   - Update tasks
   - Delete tasks
   - Pagination testing

3. **Tag Management:**
   - Create 4 tags (urgent, bug, feature, documentation)
   - Attach tags to multiple tasks
   - Filter tasks by tags

4. **Advanced Features:**
   - Automatic ID extraction from responses
   - Proper API key authentication
   - Color-coded output
   - Error handling
   - Comprehensive response validation

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Dynamic ID Extraction:** Used `jq` to parse JSON responses and extract IDs for subsequent requests
2. **Authentication Flow:** Properly chained API key generation to all authenticated requests
3. **Error Handling:** Provided fallbacks when ID extraction fails
4. **Test Data:** Created realistic, diverse test data covering various scenarios
5. **Output Formatting:** Used color coding for better readability

## Files Modified

1. **Created:** `test_api.sh` - Comprehensive API testing script
2. **Modified:** `src/controllers/taskController.ts` - Fixed delete function parameter order
3. **Modified:** `README.md` - Added API testing documentation

## Outcome

The conversation resulted in a robust, comprehensive API testing tool that:
- Tests all endpoints thoroughly
- Demonstrates proper API usage
- Serves as living documentation
- Includes realistic test scenarios
- Provides clear, actionable feedback
- Helped identify and fix a critical bug in the delete functionality

The script is now a valuable addition to the project for both testing and documentation purposes.
